# Alfred-workflow-new-folder
An Alfred workflow to create a new folder (and optionally move selected file(s) into it)

# What the workflow does

When you select one or more files in a folder and use your Universal Action hotkey one of the Universal Actions available will be `Make new folder in this folder`. You can then run this workflow which will create a new folder in the current folder with a name you choose. The workflow will offer you the option of moving the selected file(s) to the new folder.

# Note

As this workflow uses Automation Tasks please ensure your Automation Tasks are updated to the current version before running the workflow.

# Usage

Select one of more files in a folder. (Note that you must select at least one file in order for Alfred to know where he is.) Run the workflow from your Universal Actions hotkey and when prompted:
- provide a name for the new folder; and
- choose whether or not to move the selected file(s) to it.
